# One Tab per Job for Matecat
This Chrome extension ensures that, if there is already an existing Chrome tab with a [Matecat](https://www.matecat.com) job when chosing **Edit Source** a translation segment from [ApSIC Xbench](http://www.xbench.net), then such existing tab is reused instead of creating a new tab.

This extension removes the clutter of tab proliferation as you repeteadly choose **Edit Source** from Xbench, and also it avoids running out of sockets against the Matecat server when you have opened too many tabs.

This Chrome Extension is published on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/one-tab-per-job-for-matec/amlgbghdoipfolgicbijclknldenpijf) and requires the "_Read your browsing history_" permision because it has to find the Matecat job's Chrome tab among all tabs currently open in Chrome.

This Chrome extension is designed to be used in combination of [ApSIC Xbench 3.0](http://www.xbench.net) and also the [ApSIC Xbench Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apsic-xbench-extension/hocobnhnpniphphccgaliheohnobbdjo).
